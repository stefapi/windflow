* **Performance:** Consider performance and scalability impacts of any change
* **Responsible AI:** Follow the AI usage guidelines defined in `.clinerules/ai-guidelines.md`

## Scope

## Enforcement & Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at:

**Primary contact:** [conduct@windflow.dev](mailto:conduct@windflow.dev)

**Moderation team:**

* Via GitHub Issues with the `conduct` label

* Via official communication channels

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the confidentiality and safety of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the consequences of any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the affected parties, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels such as social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any form of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the affected parties, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violating community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
